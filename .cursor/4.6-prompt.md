We are working on Synapsd, a simple JSON document store built on top of LMDB, LanceDB and roaring bitmaps, intended to index and for JSON documents store data from various sources - local fs, s3, cifs share(NAS@home, NAS@work, file://random-usb/random/path), imap, iow data with any resolvable url.

Every data type is represented by a custom data abstraction schema(some of which are redundand or could be refactored to extend a common schema instead)

Our Synapsd database exports 2 central "views" on top of the index:

- A directory-like bitmap-powered "context" tree where each tree node(directory) represents a unique-by-normalized-name layer bound to a roaring bitmap; querying documents in path /foo/bar/baz returns a logical AND for layers foo, bar, baz. Paths /baf/bar and /baz/bar reference the same bitmap "bar" - a "reports" layer placed in /customers/reports will show all data tagged as reports for all customers, placing the same layer in /customers/customer-a/reports will filter only reports for customer-a
 
- This is on our TODO - A traditionall virtual directory tree where each directory is represented by a bitmap but behaves as one would expect, only indexing and returning data stored specifically into that "directory"

We currently only support the context tree abstraction (contextSpec parameter) but could easily extend it with an appropriate prefix - context://foo/bar/baz and vfs://foo/bar/baz or in some other sane way)

Besides JSON documents, we want to index "features" or to put it in a more universal language, bitmap-compatible attributes - currently implemented as a featureArray parameter.
These "Features" are of specific types and follow a path-like naming convention, the idea is to be able to easily query lets say all apps for device/id/aabbccdd or device/os/linux
The current implementation is not very flexible and only supports OR for the featureArray query(we can query all data tagged tag/foo OR data/abstraction/note OR data/abstraction/tab)

The last functionality are queries:
- Time-range/time-based (all documents created today, Monday, this week and !tuesday, 20251105 - 20251106, thisMonth etc)
- Full text query on top of a prefiltered set of IDs from our bitmap-based indexes
- Vector db based search on top of a prefiltered set of DIs from our bitmap-based indexes

Now, user facing application will allow users to index every ingested document to multiple pahts directly so our contextSpec should support an array of paths (lets say, my JSON document about an agent runtime belongs to /ml/agents and /projects/canvas-agentd), but we also may want to link documents to other documents - hence documents themselves should support being tied to a bitmap (LMDB is fast, sparse roaring bitmaps are fast too + this is not a very common use-case for now) - this is partly implemented already

Now, our tasks are as follows

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media
BitmapCollection


First, the index.js has over 2k loc - while I've seen worse, we could probably streamline the architecture according to industry best practices - move utils methods to a separate file



We will also need to cleanup our context tree implementation to use ulids internally and probably optimize some tree operations especially on layer renames (ulid ids will come in handy because of their chronologic order compared to uuid)



Additionally, we will have to implement a 2nd
